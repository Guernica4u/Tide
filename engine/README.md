# Tide's fast engine

Websites open through these files. They need service workers, and they stream
pages like a normal browser instead of fetching every script before showing anything.

| `ctl.js`, `ctl-page.js`, `ctl-worker.js` (the controller's `controller.api.js`, `controller.inject.js`, `controller.sw.js`) | Scramjet's controller (`@mercuryworkshop/scramjet-controller` 0.0.14) by Mercury Workshop | AGPL-3.0 |

They are the builds of those projects as published, with one change in
`core.js`: the `$rfs` and `$io` tags it adds to addresses (the previous
page and the site that asked) are scrambled like the addresses themselves
(reversed, base64, marked with `~`), so a school filter can't read site names
from them. Search it for `"~"+btoa` to find the three places and the one that
reads them back.
